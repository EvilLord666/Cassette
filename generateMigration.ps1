# Script for Automate migration generation with Liquibase and Gradle!
# You MUST Pass 2 parameters :
#    1) Migration number - integer value from 1 to +INFINITY
#    2) Migration description - what was done, ONLY _ is ALLOWED to use as separator between words
#       however you could pass words separated with spaces but theese words wrapped in single quotes
#       i.e. Updated_column_xxx_name_and_added_unique_constraint_on_name
# Example .\generateMigration.ps1 5 Tables_Employee_Renamed
# Example .\generateMigration.ps1 5 'Tables Employee Renamed'
